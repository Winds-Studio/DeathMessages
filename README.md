<details>
    <summary>✎ Why this fork came out?</summary>
    <p>
        The original maintainer of DeathMessages, MrShawn, cleared his repo commits and began his rewritten version of DeathMessages.
        And on SpigotMC, the last update of DeathMessages stagnated on July 20, 2022, almost around 1 year ago! 
        Since the rewritten version has incomplete functions with slow update progress and 
        the original one had so many issues, Then this fork came out.
    <p>
        This fork based on DeathMessages 1.4.15. I will continue to maintain this fork to fix issues left in the original plugin, 
        and add some new features maybe.
